- [ ] Enhance color scheme and visual design (modern gradients, shadows, rounded corners, better contrast)
- [ ] Add hover and focus effects to buttons, links, and interactive elements
- [ ] Improve table readability (zebra striping, better padding, font sizes)
- [ ] Ensure accessibility (ARIA labels, focus indicators, keyboard navigation)
- [ ] Add subtle transitions and animations for smoother interactions
- [ ] Test layout on different screen sizes (optional, but verify in browser)
